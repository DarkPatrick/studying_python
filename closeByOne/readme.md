# Close by one algorithm.

It is meant for finding formal concepts.

File "main.py" contains input of number of objects, attributes and matrix, where rows are objects and columns - attributes.
example of input:

3  
3  
1 0 1  
1 1 0  
1 0 1  

Output: lines of sets of formal concepts

File "formal_concepts.py" contains all necessary classes and methods to proceed the algorithm.

I hope, i'll write comments one day
